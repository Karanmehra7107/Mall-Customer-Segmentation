## Clustering - Observation

-a. High Income, High Spending Score (Cluster 5) - Target these customers by sending new product alerts which would lead to increase in the revenue collected by the mall as they are loyal customers.

-b. High Income, Low Spending Score (Cluster 3) - Target these customers by asking the feedback and advertising the product in a better way to convert them into Cluster 5 customers.

-c. Average Income, Average Spending Score (Cluster 2) - Can target these set of customers by providing them with Low cost EMI's etc.

-d. Low Income, High Spending Score (Cluster 1) - May or may not target these group of customers based on the policy of the mall.

-e. Low Income, Low Spending Score (Cluster 4) - Don't target these customers since they have less income and need to save money.
